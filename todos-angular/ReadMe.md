Create a to-do list app with Angular.\
A to-do list app lets you write, organize, and reprioritize your tasks more efficiently. They also let you attach notes, links, and files to a task, and many let you see when someone else has completed a task. In many ways, a good to-do app is the ultimate productivity app.

# Specifications

A task has: 
- a title 
- a deadline
- a description
- a priority
- a status: to know the progress of a task. for example the status __"completed"__ can be used to describe a task which is already done
- and optionally links and attachments.

# Features

- Creating and saving tasks
- Editing task details
- Attach files to tasks: a file in this context can be for example a picture
- Displaying tasks: here, you should provide filters (searching tasks according to priorities, titles, status). 
- Notify tasks whose deadline has been exceeded

**Note:** 
- Once finished, make a demo video of your application that you will save on drive and put the link in a READMe
- A well organized code will always be welcomed
- And finally, the most important thing here in this project is to let your creativity flow.
  
Good luck.
